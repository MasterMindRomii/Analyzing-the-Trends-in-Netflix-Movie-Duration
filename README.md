# Analyzing-the-Trends-in-Netflix-Movie-Duration

In the realm of Netflix entertainment, a noteworthy revelation has emerged concerning the average duration of movies over the past decade. Budi, our insightful data analyst, suspects a decreasing trend in the average movie length on Netflix. Supporting this claim, he has meticulously provided a decade-spanning dataset covering the years 2011 to 2020, with average movie durations ranging from 103 minutes in 2011 to 90 minutes in 2020.

This dataset invites us to delve into the temporal evolution of Netflix movie durations, examining patterns that may underlie this apparent decline. As we embark on this analytical journey, our goal is to unravel the contributing factors, determining whether they signify shifting viewer preferences, industry trends, or other influencing variables. The gradual decline in average movie lengths, reflected in the data (103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90 minutes), will be subjected to rigorous data analysis and visualization to draw meaningful insights, validating Budi’s hypothesis and providing illumination on the broader dynamics shaping the Netflix content landscape.

The narrative arising from this exploration promises valuable perspectives on the ever-changing nature of digital entertainment platforms and the content they curate. By decoding the trends within this dataset, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors driving transformations in the content offerings of one of the world’s leading streaming services.
